      <h3>The wise monk's start and early life </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body panel-bodies">
      Ajahn Chah was born in a rural village in northeast Thailand in 1917 near Ubon. He lived a childhood and early life typical to those of other Thai farming boys of those days, including, as custom in some parts of the region, spending several years as a <em>novice</em> in a Buddhist monastery starting at age 9. He left, as some do, to return home and help his family on their farm. Eventually, he felt a draw back to the monastic Buddhist lifestyle, he reentered a <em>Wat</em> to be ordained as a <em>Bhikku</em>, a Buddhist monk. Upon the death of his father, he realized the <mark>transcience</mark> of life and instilled within him a desire to learn the <mark><strong>essence of Buddha's teachings.</strong></mark> It was at that point, he decided to live life as an <strong>ascetic</strong>, a pilgriming monk, learning teachings across various monasterious while traveling across Thailand. He eventually met Ajahn Mun Bhuridatto, a renowned forest meditation master of his time. At the time, he was having trouble learning how to put some extensive Buddhist sciptures into full practice. Ajahn Mun replied by stating
      <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
        <p> at their heart they are very simple. With mindfulness established, if it is seen everything that arises in the heart-mind: right there is the true path of practice.</p>

      His time with Ajahn Mun brought great revelations to him. For the following seven years, practiced the <em>austere Forest Tradition</em> of an ascetic monk. Many times he traveled and meditated in jungles, caves, cremation grounds as well as to overcome certain fears he still held. For example, he traveled to animal infested jungles that could have tigers and cobras, where through the constant danger of death, he could ponder the meaning of life. Through meditating in a cremation ground, to challenge his fear of mortality. Through times alone during brutal and rainstorms, he learned and accepted the isolation and desolation of being a homeless monk.

    <h3>Ajahn Chah's Contributions</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body panel-bodies">
    <p>Eventually Ajahn Chah was invited to settle into a forest grove around the village of his birth. His impeccable methods of teaching and meditation began to attract many monks, nuns, and commoners towards him. This eventually led to a large monastery being formed around the area. As his monastery grew in influence, words of his teaching style spread. In 1966, Ajahn Chah received his first western disciple, Sumedho Bhikku. The Bhikku had came to Ajahn Chah in order to find a teacher where he could fully in every aspect of the monastic lifestyle. Ajahn Chah welcomed him in, but insisted that he be given no special treatment, that he must practice and live as every other monk or nun in the monastery did. From then on, the number of foreign visitors began to increase at a steady rate. Since Sumedho Bhikku had gained enough knowledge and experience, he was permitted to teach where he and a group of other Western Bhikkus came to study in a forest near <strong>Wat Nong Pah Pong</strong>.

      There, with the help and encouragement of local villagers,they eventually built <strong>Wat Pah Nanachat</strong>(International Forest Monastery). A monastery that was run by and was run for English-speaking Buddhist monks. Through 1977 to 1980, Ajahn Chah, along with his closest of followers, would travel to Britain and across Europe to teach, helping to establish a monastery in Sussex and going on to continue teaching in Canada and the U.S.</p>

    <h3>Ajahn Chah's Qualities and Teaching Style</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body panel-bodies">
    <p>Ajahn Chah was known for a simple, yet deep and wise style of teaching. It would be said one should not be deceived by his simplicity for that <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
    "It is only after we have heard something many times that suddenly our minds aree ripe and somehow the teaching takes on a much deeper meaning"<footer>Passage from <cite title="The Teachings of Ajahn Chah">The Teachings of Ajahn Chah (xv)</cite></footer>
    </blockquote>Ajahn Chah was known for tailoring his sermons and teachings to the time and place he spoke of them, with consideration taken to whatever audience he was speaking to and whatever events may have transpired recently, always speaking truly and passionately from the heart with no notes or any rehearsals.

    He endeavored to preserve a simple monastic lifestyle so that anyone could successfully practice the Dhamma in present-day. He was also noted for having an outstanding approach to meditation, simple but direct method of teaching, emphasizing practical application and a balanced attitude. His monks and nuns would undergo many tests of endurance, including long work projects, in order to enhance their resolve and patience and to even disrupt any attachment to tranquility for he saw surrending to the way things are and to build discipline. This style would attract large crowds of other monks, nuns, and common villagers at his first monastery, and eventually westerners as well, regardless of status or education level. His main goal could be considered as providing a path to <em>liberation</em> for his listeners. Even during health deterioration due to diabetes, he would use his body as a demonstration of the impermanence of all things and that people should learn to find refuge within themselves.</p>

      <li><blockquote>
        "In 1979 in Barre, Massachusetts, during a question-and-answer session while on retreat, someone asked Ajahn Chah, 'Is it necessarily a barrier to be in a sexual relationship? Can one not view sex in terms of it being the dance of the sacred marriage? Couldn't it be noble and mystical?' After Ajahn Chah had the question translated, he pondered for a moment and then started picking his nose in a very graphic and extended way. When everyone was rolling on the floor laughing and he was sure they definitely got the point, he pulled his finger out of his nose: 'There's nothing more to it than that, except what the mind adds to it.' Perhaps this story has been altered a bit in the telling, but it's still a good story." <footer>Passage from a <a href="http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebdha299.htm">blog post</a> on budsas.org for <cite title="Monastery">Abhyagiri Buddhist Monastery</cite></footer>

          “When you listen to the Dhamma, you must open
up your heart and compose yourself in its centre. Don’t try and accumulate
what you hear, or make painstaking efforts to retain it through
your memory. Just let the Dhamma flow into your heart as it reveals
itself, and keep yourself continuously open to the flow in the present
moment. What is ready to be retained will remain. It will happen of its
own accord, not through forced effort on your part"<footer class="footer-text">Given in September 25, 1978 at Wat Nong Pah Pong.

          "When you contemplate and see impermanence, suffering and notself,
there will no longer be clinging to a self, a being, I or he or she.
The mind which sees this will give rise to nibbida¯, disenchantment and
dispassion. It will see all things as only impermanent, suffering and
not-self.
The mind then stops. The mind is Dhamma. Greed, hatred and
delusion will then diminish and recede little by little until finally there is
only mind – just the pure mind. This is called “practicing meditation”.
Thus, I ask you to receive this gift of Dhamma which I offer you to
study and contemplate in your daily lives"
