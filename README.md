# Free-Code-Camp-Tribute-Page

This page will be the location for the source code for my first project done at 
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page">freecodecamp.com</a>

The location for the actual project itself is at my <a href="http://codepen.io/joshpas4991/pen/LbBvqE">codepen homepage</a>.

Codepen is a great location to build front end web and mobile apps since it allows users to run html, css, and any Javascript code concurrently with ease and import any libraries such as bootstrap through just adjusting the settings. I found it great for learning front-end webdev. 

Another helpful link were the instructions and documentation regarding the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/"> use of bootstrap css and javascript.</a>

For more themes try <a href="https://bootswatch.com/">bootswatch</a>

Very basic webpage with html and css.

Basic Bootstrap link:  https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css
